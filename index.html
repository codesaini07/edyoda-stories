                    <h2>Intoduction to machine learning</h2>
                    <p>Machine learning is programming computers to optimize a perfoemance criterion using eaxmples data
                        or
                        past expireance. We have a model defined up to some parameters of the model using the training
                        data
                        or past experience.

                    <h2>Impact of Cloud Computing in various industries</h2>
                    <p>Cloud computing has been rapidly gaining pace in the world of information technology. It has been
                        observed that over 90% of global enterprises are using cloud technology as part of their
                        business. Every industry has its own technology dynamics designed to suit its infrastructure. To
                        understand the future of cloud computing, one needs to understand the dynamics of cloud
                        computing in various key industries.

                    <h2>Cyber Security: Analysis of the digital world</h2>
                    <p>When computers were standalone devices, security was a minimal concern. Mainframes had their own
                        protected facilities. Slowly and steadily as computing became more personal, security became the
                        personal responsibility too. The use of computers increasingly involves networks of computers
                        for messaging, on-line transactions, remote hosting.

                    <h2>Importance of Data Backup and Recovery in the IT industry</h2>
                    <p>A business must always introspect the areas where they lack in order to bring about a positive
                        change in the work environment. One of the main precautions or a contingency plan that is
                        necessary for every business and especially industries working with clouds, networks and
                        computers should conduct a backup of its files which will serve as a boon in any point of time.

                    <h2>What is Web Scraping?</h2>
                    <p>Introducing web scraping

                        Simply put, web scraping is one of the tools developers use to gather and analyze information
                        from the Internet.

                        Some websites and platforms offer application programming interfaces (APIs) which we can use to
                        access information in a structured way, but others might not.
